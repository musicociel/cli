Musicociel command-line utility
===

This repository contains a command line utility, related to the Musicociel application, allowing to manage songs (e.g. converting them between multiple formats, synchronizing them with a CouchDB-compatible database).

To install it globally, you can use yarn:

```
yarn global add @musicociel/cli
```

Or if you prefer npm:

```
npm install -g @musicociel/cli
```

This installs a global `musicociel` utility.

This is a work in progress. More documentation will be added later.
